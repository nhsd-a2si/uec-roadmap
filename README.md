# Roadmap Kit - an easy to update, responsive HTML+CSS (no JS) roadmap

One page, draws columns with fixed sized units (so watch your character counts) with clickable popups with a bigger info sheet - uses HTML5 details/summary so no JS needed.

install it locally
`git clone https://github.com/nhsd-a2si/uec-roadmap.git roadmap`

move into the new directory
`cd roadmap`

install all the dependencies
`npm install`

duplicate the roadmap-0519.html file and make your edits 

commit and push
`git add .`
`git commit -m "my updated roadmap"`
`git push nhsd-a2si master`

It's recommended to set up a Herokuapp to look at the repo and automatically publish updates

Advisable to make a duplicate of the most recent file - roadmap-0519.html at time of writing, and dive in.

## Based on GOV.UK Prototype kit (but not much)

Go to the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit site](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs) to download the latest version and read the documentation.

## About the prototype kit

The prototype kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look like pages on GOV.UK. These prototypes can be used to show ideas to people you work with, and to do user research.

Read the [project principles](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/principles).

## Security

If you publish your prototypes online, they **must** be protected by a [username and password](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/publishing-on-heroku). This is to prevent members of the public finding prototypes and thinking they are real services.

You must protect user privacy at all times, even when using prototypes. Prototypes made with the kit look like GOV.UK, but do not have the same security provisions. Always make sure you are handling user data appropriately.
